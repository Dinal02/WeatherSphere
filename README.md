# WeatherSphere

WeatherSphere is a web-app that can provide you the weather of different cities around the world. You just have to search the city name and it will show you the weather data of that particular city.

WeatherSphere is a web project that I made while learning web development. I have made it using HTML, CSS and Javascript. By fetching a weather API, I have displayed the weather of various cities.

Here are some screenshots of the WeatherSphere
